Ideally we want to be able to manipulate the position in this way:
  position.makeMove(m);
  position.unmakeMove(m);
Calling both make and unmake with the same move object.

Every move requires these three things in order to make that move:
  from square
  to square
  move type

Additional information is required in order to unmake the move. For example, if
a capture is made, we need to remember what piece was captured in order to
unmake that move.

Unmaking moves requires this information from prior to the move:
  clock
  en passant file
  castling rights
  captured piece type

Note that for en passant, it is sufficient to keep track of only the file on
which en passant capture is possible. When making or unmaking the move, the
rank of the captured pawn can be derived from whose turn it is.
